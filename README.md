## Motivation

During a product management course I had this question in mind, how can we practice product management without working as a PM?
Being a PM is a big responsibility and there isn't space to let someone naive to let in.

Like a developer or a designer, a product manager should be able to show her ability to think about products. These challenges are about it.

### Value Proposition

We can learn anything, it is a matter of practice and how can we practice product management without being a product person? This is what we cant to solve here.
Offer challenges to people work with and learn by doing.

### Inspiration

This idea came out from my experience learning how to code. I'm still learning in fact!
[Frontend Mentors](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) is a product that gives us front-end challenges to the practice. I've learned a lot using it.
I also look at other similar products such as UX tools, that has [UX Challenges](https://uxtools.co/challenges/). And [Dialy UI](https://www.dailyui.co/) to help designers.
I thought that is the time to do something for product managers.
